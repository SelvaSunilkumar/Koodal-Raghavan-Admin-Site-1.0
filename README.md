# Koodal-Raghavan-Admin-Site-1.0
An website created initially to make the admin to put files and modify the database when a file is uploaded to the server. This page is currently running live but due to poor UI a new set of code is developed along with good security features.

The uploading of data is completely based on the configuration specifed in php.ini in the server. Also the configuration in nginx also should be modified to use this application usefully.
